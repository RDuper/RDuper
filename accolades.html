<h1> My Accolades </h1>

<p> Over my lifetime I have recieved a few accolades for accomplishments made. Here are some listed down below: </p>

<li> * 2014-2015 High School Track State Championship
<li> * Deans list for the first three semesters of my college career
<li> * 2014 Waterville High School Graduate
<li> * Group picture with Waterville Mayor for helping run a charity event
<li> * Name in local paper for noticing a house catching fire early in the morning

<p> I have not yet lived a very long life, and so any accomplishments I have gotten seen small in comparison to some people that I know
who are older. That said I am proud of the things I have done and hope to accomplish some great things into addulthood.
